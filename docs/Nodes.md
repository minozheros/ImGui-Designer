# ImGui Widgets and Node/Block Types

This document lists (or will list) standard ImGui widgets and custom node/block types supported by ImGui-Designer.

> Source file migrated from root `README_NODES.md` to keep repository root uncluttered.

## Purpose

- Provide a checklist / coverage map of ImGui primitives wrapped as blocks.
- Identify missing or planned nodes for future implementation.
- Serve as a reference when reviewing incoming contributions.

## Coverage Strategy (Planned Sections)

| Category | Examples | Status Notes |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Basic Widgets | Button, Checkbox, RadioButton | TBD |
| Value Editors | InputInt, InputFloat, SliderFloat | TBD |
| Text & Display | Text, Label, ProgressBar | TBD |
| Layout Helpers | SameLine, Separator, Spacing | TBD |
| Containers | BeginChild, TreeNode, CollapsingHeader | TBD |
| Menus & Bars | BeginMenuBar, BeginMenu, MenuItem | TBD |
| Popups & Modals | OpenPopup, BeginPopupModal | TBD |
| Drag & Drop | BeginDragDropSource/Target | TBD |
| Tables | BeginTable, TableNextRow, etc. | TBD |
| Plotting (ImPlot) | PlotLines, PlotBars | TBD |
| Custom Types | ColorPicker, Image, ImageButton | TBD |
| Advanced | DockSpace, Viewport, Multi-viewport | TBD |

## Future Enhancements

- Link to auto-generated symbol coverage report (planned tooling).
- Add status badges (Complete / In Progress / Blocked / Experimental).
- Auto-sync with LibraryDescriptor metadata when available.
