docs(cleanup): remove root documentation stubs now in docs/

Remove deprecated root doc files after successful migration to docs/:
 - EXTENSIBILITY.md (full content lives at docs/EXTENSIBILITY.md)
 - README_NODES.md  -> docs/Nodes.md
 - NOTES.md         -> docs/Notes.md
 - CONTRIBUTING_MANIFESTS.md -> docs/ContributingManifests.md

Result: root directory now retains only README.md (plus source/build files) for a cleaner top-level surface; all topic-specific docs are centralized under docs/ with index updates already in place.

chore(extensibility): add uiAdapters schema and interface scaffolding

Add `uiAdapters` to `LibraryDescriptor.schema.json` with expanded adapter types:
 - frameHook, layoutEngine (multi-stage hooks + layout strategies)
 - optional target + stages array for frame-level adapters

Introduce initial extensibility interfaces and registry scaffolding (header-only):
 - IReplaceable, ITypeAdapter, IBlockRenderer, IPanelRenderer, IFrameHook, ILayoutEngine
 - ReplaceableRegistry<T> and registrySingleton accessor
 - Forward declarations + registry access helpers

Add `EXTENSIBILITY.md` documenting goals, schema touchpoint, proposed frame stages, roadmap.

No runtime wiring yet; purely structural groundwork for future pluggable components.

docs(extensibility): document planned Customization Pack

Add detailed section covering: objectives, layering precedence (Core < Descriptor < Pack < UserPack < Session), phased rollout, adapter categories, sample user config, schema evolution candidates, safety measures, overlay pack export structure, and success criteria. Markdown lint issues addressed (spacing, tabs, fenced language, angle bracket escaping).
feat(schema): introduce LibraryDescriptor + blocklist extensions

Add LibraryDescriptor schema with symbol inventory, block metadata, profiles, and BLOCKED/HIDDEN status support. Extend FeatureSet and Package schemas to reference descriptors and apply layered blocklists. Update validate_manifests.py to load and validate LibraryDescriptor files (optional) and support new fields.

Includes:
- schemas/LibraryDescriptor.schema.json (new)
- schemas/FeatureSet.schema.json (libraryDescriptors, descriptorProfiles, blocklist)
- schemas/Package.schema.json (blocklist)
- scripts/validate_manifests.py (descriptor validation hook)

No runtime code yet consumes these; purely structural groundwork.

docs(structure): move extensibility doc into docs/ and add index

- Relocated full `EXTENSIBILITY.md` to `docs/EXTENSIBILITY.md` with root stub pointer for backward compatibility.
- Added `docs/README.md` as central documentation index.
- Updated root `README.md` with Documentation section linking to docs.
- Fixed markdown formatting issues (lists, angle brackets) during move.

docs(cleanup): consolidate root docs and add Nodes reference

- Migrated `README_NODES.md` to `docs/Nodes.md` and removed original.
- Deleted root `EXTENSIBILITY.md` stub (primary doc already in `docs/`).
- Added Nodes link to `docs/README.md` index and root `README.md` Documentation section.
- Ensured commit message reflects restructuring for historical traceability.
