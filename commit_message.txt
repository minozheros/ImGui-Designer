feat(i18n): introduce basic translation system (en/de) + menu localization + language switcher

Includes follow-up compile fixes: add missing TranslationManager include in MainMenuBar.cpp and update SDL context destruction call to SDL_GL_DestroyContext for SDL3.

Summary
Add a lightweight translation infrastructure supporting English and German with extensibility for future translation packs. Localize main menu items, About dialog, and settings toggle. Provide runtime language switching persisted in preferences.

Details
- src/i18n/TranslationManager.[hpp,cpp]:
  - Singleton managing language catalogs (JSON). Supports loadLanguage(lang), translate(key), plural(baseKey,count).
  - Fallback to English if requested language fails.
  - Simple plural handling (English/German: one vs other) with token replacement {0}.
- i18n/en.json & i18n/de.json: Base catalogs for core UI strings (menus, about dialog, layout actions, bottom bar toggle, packs plural examples).
- MainMenuBar.cpp:
  - Replace hardcoded labels with TR() lookups.
  - Add Settings->Language submenu (English / Deutsch) persisting selection to preferences (ui.language).
- main.cpp:
  - Load preferred language at startup (ui.language, default 'en').
- schemas/Package.schema.json:
  - Add optional "translations" block (languages[], paths[]) preparing for future translation packs.
- src/i18n/PackTranslationHook.hpp:
  - Placeholder helper to register pack-provided catalogs in future pack installation flow.

Behavioral Changes
- Users can switch language at runtime; change persists across sessions.
- Missing keys gracefully fall back to the key itself (with English fallback attempt first).

Testing
- Reconfigure/build succeeded; no new warnings beyond existing third-party deprecation in crude_json.h.
- Manual inspection: translation manager compiled, menu labels now dynamic.
- Follow-up rebuild after include + SDL destroy fix succeeded (clean build, tests pass).

Limitations / Future Work
- No hot reload for catalog edits yet (requires explicit language reselect).
- No advanced plural categories or gender/context (extend later via CLDR mapping if needed).
- Pack integration hook present but not wired into installer logic yet.

Follow-Up Ideas
- Integrate pack translation registration during pack install step.
- Add CI check ensuring en.json is superset baseline.
- Expose language choice in first-run modal once translations expand.

Refs
- Implements initial multi-language groundwork (English + German) per user request; enables contributions via future translation packs.
