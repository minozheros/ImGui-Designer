Add !c command rule to agent instructions

- Added a section to .github/instructions/first.instructions.md defining the !c command as the trigger for the agent to create a commit.
- The agent will now stage all relevant files, update commit_message.txt with a clear message, and use git commit -F commit_message.txt when !c is issued.
- If the user provides a message, it will be used; otherwise, the agent will generate a concise, descriptive message.
