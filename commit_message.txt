Fix X11 multi-monitor mouse coordinates and implement node factory

- Fix: X11 multi-monitor coordinate handling for unfocused windows
  - Added conservative coordinate correction in render_imgui_designer_window.hpp
  - Only overrides invalid ImGui coordinates when mouse is within window bounds
  - Prevents "mouse focus all over the place" issues in multi-screen setups

- Fix: NodeFactory implementation for visual node creation
  - Implemented createBlockByName() to actually instantiate node objects
  - Added unique NodeId generation using atomic counter
  - BeginComboNode now properly created and added to node editor

- Fix: Toolbar button functionality restored
  - Button clicks now create and display nodes in ImGui Node Editor
  - Resolved issue where nodes weren't appearing despite successful clicks

- Update: Re-enabled toolbar search autofocus after testing
- Update: Enhanced logging for coordinate debugging and node creation

These changes restore full functionality to the visual programming interface,
ensuring reliable mouse interaction across X11 multi-monitor configurations
and proper node instantiation in the node editor.
