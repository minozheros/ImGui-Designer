Add vector<IParameterBase*> aggregation to generated blocks
Generator now emits a std::vector<core::IParameterBase*> member for each block
Constructor populates vector with all block parameters
Regenerate parameter structs and fix bracket output in generator script.
Parameter structs now inherit from core::IParameterParamsBase.
All generated code follows project conventions and rules from .github/instructions/first.instructions.md.
Manual edits to interfaces and map files have been respected.
Includes are grouped at the top, code is formatted consistently, and no redundant brackets remain in generated files.
