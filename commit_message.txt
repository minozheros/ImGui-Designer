Refine BeginComboNode layout: centered title, right-aligned outputs, external bullets

- Center the node title horizontally using cursor positioning
- Align output section to the right edge of the node
- Position input bullets on the left (outside) and output bullets on the right (outside)
- Create clear visual flow: inputs → node → outputs
- Improve overall node aesthetics and connection point visibility

This refined layout establishes the visual standard for node design,
with centered titles, proper alignment, and external bullet indicators
for optimal readability and connection clarity.
