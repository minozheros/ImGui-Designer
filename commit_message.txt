Refactor BeginComboNode layout for better visual design

- Restructure BeginComboNode to have clear left/right separation:
  - Left side: Inputs with bullet indicators and labels
  - Right side: Outputs with bullet indicators
  - Bottom: Parameter controls

- Add visual bullet indicators for all pins to show connection points
- Improve node readability and data flow visualization
- Maintain all existing functionality while improving UI layout

This serves as the reference implementation for automated node generation,
showing proper pin placement, visual indicators, and organized layout.
