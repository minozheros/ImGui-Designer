Refactor imgui-node-editor integration: local subdirectory & FetchContent

- Moved FetchContent logic for imgui-node-editor to third_party/imgui-node-editor/CMakeLists.txt
- Now uses add_subdirectory for consistent third-party management (like imgui, fmod)
- Automatically fetches source if missing, or uses local copy
- Keeps top-level CMakeLists.txt clean and robust
Refactor toolbar UI, docking, and workflow; document ImGui docking limitations
