 fix(cmake,build,store): Guard generator test deps + reconfigure path; fix AppStateStore save path; green reconfigures and tests
 
 Summary
 - Prevent CMake generator from failing when tests are disabled by removing unconditional add_dependencies to ImGui-Designer_tests in GenerateImGuiApiInfo.cmake and moving guarded test deps into CMakeLists.txt (only if tests are enabled and targets exist).
 - Fix AppStateStore::saveLastLeftTab() to use the instance statePath instead of an undefined kStatePath when merging existing JSON.
 
 Details
 - cmake/generators/GenerateImGuiApiInfo.cmake:
	 - Keep add_dependencies for ImGui-Designer on generator targets.
	 - Remove references to ImGui-Designer_tests to avoid configure-time errors when IMGUIDESIGNER_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF or before tests target is defined.
 - CMakeLists.txt:
	 - After target definitions, conditionally add generator deps to ImGui-Designer_tests if IMGUIDESIGNER_ENABLE_TESTS is ON and the generator targets exist.
 - src/app/state/AppStateStore.cpp:
	 - Replace stray kStatePath with statePath in saveLastLeftTab() and maintain merge semantics.
 
 Outcomes
 - Reconfigure-only builds succeed without requiring clean, regardless of tests option.
 - App and tests build green; ctest passes the existing unit test.
 - Keeps generator logic robust and future-proof against optional test configurations.
 
 Refs
 - Addresses the reconfigure failure: "Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target 'ImGui-Designer_tests'".

Build / CMake
- Prefer system-installed SDL3 (find_package/pkg-config). Fetch SDL3 only if not found.
- When fetching SDL3 as a subproject:
	- New toggles: IMGUIDESIGNER_USE_BUNDLED_SDL3 (force bundled), IMGUIDESIGNER_SDL_SAFE_ALSA_ONLY (preset for ALSA-only + PipeWire off).
	- Optional backend flags when bundling: IMGUIDESIGNER_DISABLE_SDL_PIPEWIRE, IMGUIDESIGNER_SDL_ALSA_ONLY.
	- Defaults are OFF; enable the preset to match ALSA-only builds when needed.
	- Disable SDL_INSTALL to keep the subproject lean.
- Conditional SDL3 include dirs (source include vs system include) based on USE_FETCHED_SDL3.
- Keep OpenGL and other deps unchanged; maintain CONFIGURE_DEPENDS GLOB for sources.

UI / UX
- Add MainMenuBar (File/View/Settings/Help):
	- File→Quit dispatches quit event.
	- View→Save/Load/Reset layout via LayoutStore.
	- Settings→Show Bottom Bar toggle persisted to preferences.
- Persist and restore last selected left dock tab (Toolbar, Pack Manager, Pack Viewer) via AppStateStore.
- Default focus: Toolbar unless no packs; first run prompts to install Standard Core pack.
- Move Pack Manager and Pack Viewer tabs next to Toolbar on the left; set minimum dock width; re-dock on existing layouts.
- Toolbar search only autofocuses when Toolbar tab is focused (no focus stealing).

State / Persistence
- Add AppStateStore (registry/app_state.json) for last-left-tab.
- Add LayoutStore to save/load/reset ImGui layout (registry/layout.ini); const-safe SaveIniSettingsToMemory usage.
- Wire stores into AppContext and render loop; bottom bar visibility now respects a persisted preference.

Packs / Schemas / CI
- Add JSON Schemas: FeatureSet, Package, Tutorial, LibraryRegistry, PackIndex.
- Add example and official registries (packs.example.json, packs.official.json) and libraries.example.json.
- Add Python tools: fetch_packs.py and validate_manifests.py; integrate validation as a build step and CI workflow (.github/workflows/validate-manifests.yml).
- Update PackIndexLoader to load and present packs in Pack Manager/Viewer.

Code / Files touched (high level)
- CMakeLists.txt (SDL3 strategy, ALSA-only and PipeWire toggles, conditional includes).
- src/ui/rendering/RenderImGuiDesignerWindow.hpp (menu integration; tab persistence; first-run logic; bottom bar toggle).
- src/ui/components/MainMenuBar.{hpp,cpp} (new).
- src/app/state/{AppStateStore,LayoutStore}.{hpp,cpp} (new) + AppContext wiring and main.cpp setup.
- src/ui/panels/* (PackManagerPanel, PackViewerPanel, FirstRunModal) and ToolbarPanel focus behavior.
- src/ui/docking/DockingManager.cpp (left tabs placement and sizing).
- schemas/*, registry/*, featuresets/*, packages/*, tutorials/* (manifests and examples).
- .github/workflows/validate-manifests.yml (CI validation).
- NodeEditor.json and CONTRIBUTING_MANIFESTS.md adjustments.

Validation
- Reconfigure+Build: successful; ImGui-Designer and tests built cleanly.
- build/build.log captured; no PipeWire compile errors.
- Behavior validated manually: menu appears; layout actions functional; last-left-tab persists; first-run prompt shown when no packs.

Docs
- README: Add section “SDL3 selection and audio backends”, documenting system vs bundled behavior, ALSA-safe preset, per-backend toggles, and SDL_AUDIODRIVER tips.

Notes
- System SDL3 remains untouched; bundled SDL3 receives ALSA-only and no-PipeWire defaults to match typical ALSA environments and avoid fragile PipeWire headers.
- Options IMGUIDESIGNER_DISABLE_SDL_PIPEWIRE and IMGUIDESIGNER_SDL_ALSA_ONLY can be toggled if needed.
