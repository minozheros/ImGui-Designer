Update generator, base types, and includes for ImGui node parameter automation.
 - Generator scripts now emit parameter structs inheriting from IParameterParamsBase.
 - ParameterBase<T> refactored to inherit from new IParameterBase for heterogeneous vector support.
 - Regenerated all parameter structs and node_params_map.hpp.
 - Build validated successfully.
 - Includes checked and adjusted for vector and base type usage.
 - All changes follow project conventions and encapsulation rules.
 - See NOTES.md for design decisions and details.
Add vector<IParameterBase*> aggregation to generated blocks
Generator now emits a std::vector<core::IParameterBase*> member for each block
Constructor populates vector with all block parameters
Regenerate parameter structs and fix bracket output in generator script.
Parameter structs now inherit from core::IParameterParamsBase.
All generated code follows project conventions and rules from .github/instructions/first.instructions.md.
Manual edits to interfaces and map files have been respected.
Includes are grouped at the top, code is formatted consistently, and no redundant brackets remain in generated files.
