Refactor imgui-node-editor integration: local subdirectory & FetchContent

- Moved FetchContent logic for imgui-node-editor to third_party/imgui-node-editor/CMakeLists.txt
- Now uses add_subdirectory for consistent third-party management (like imgui, fmod)
- Automatically fetches source if missing, or uses local copy
- Keeps top-level CMakeLists.txt clean and robust
Refactor toolbar UI, docking, and workflow; document ImGui docking limitations

Fix: Remove empty namespace block and enforce include order in visual_window.cpp

- Removed redundant empty namespace block at the top of visual_window.cpp.
- Moved all #include directives to the very top of the file, before any namespace or code, for compliance with project rules.
- No functional changes.

Also updated assistant workflow rules to explicitly forbid empty/redundant namespace blocks and require all includes at the very top of each file.
