 fix(cmake,build,store): Guard generator test deps + reconfigure path; fix AppStateStore save path; green reconfigures and tests
 
 Summary
 - Prevent CMake generator from failing when tests are disabled by removing unconditional add_dependencies to ImGui-Designer_tests in GenerateImGuiApiInfo.cmake and moving guarded test deps into CMakeLists.txt (only if tests are enabled and targets exist).
 - Fix AppStateStore::saveLastLeftTab() to use the instance statePath instead of an undefined kStatePath when merging existing JSON.
 
 Details
 - cmake/generators/GenerateImGuiApiInfo.cmake:
	 - Keep add_dependencies for ImGui-Designer on generator targets.
	 - Remove references to ImGui-Designer_tests to avoid configure-time errors when IMGUIDESIGNER_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF or before tests target is defined.
 - CMakeLists.txt:
	 - After target definitions, conditionally add generator deps to ImGui-Designer_tests if IMGUIDESIGNER_ENABLE_TESTS is ON and the generator targets exist.
 - src/app/state/AppStateStore.cpp:
	 - Replace stray kStatePath with statePath in saveLastLeftTab() and maintain merge semantics.
 
 Outcomes
 - Reconfigure-only builds succeed without requiring clean, regardless of tests option.
 - App and tests build green; ctest passes the existing unit test.
 - Keeps generator logic robust and future-proof against optional test configurations.
 
 Refs
 - Addresses the reconfigure failure: "Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target 'ImGui-Designer_tests'".

fix(ui:first-run): Modal now dismisses properly (Install / Skip) and no longer reopens

Summary

Details
	- Added dismissed_ / installing_ / installSucceeded_ flags; guarded open() against re-entry.
	- Rewrote render() to use keepOpen flag and explicit CloseCurrentPopup() on exit paths.
	- Changed isOpen() semantic to exclude dismissed state; added isDismissed().
	- Only call open() when !isOpen() && !isDismissed().

Behavioral Changes

Outcome

Build / CMake
	- New toggles: IMGUIDESIGNER_USE_BUNDLED_SDL3 (force bundled), IMGUIDESIGNER_SDL_SAFE_ALSA_ONLY (preset for ALSA-only + PipeWire off).
	- Optional backend flags when bundling: IMGUIDESIGNER_DISABLE_SDL_PIPEWIRE, IMGUIDESIGNER_SDL_ALSA_ONLY.
	- Defaults are OFF; enable the preset to match ALSA-only builds when needed.
	- Disable SDL_INSTALL to keep the subproject lean.

UI / UX
	- File→Quit dispatches quit event.
	- View→Save/Load/Reset layout via LayoutStore.
	- Settings→Show Bottom Bar toggle persisted to preferences.

Notes

UX: After installing Standard Core or skipping first-run modal, automatically focus Pack Manager
- Added requestFocusPackManager_ flag in FirstRunModal with accessors.
- Set flag on successful install, skip, or close after attempted install.
- Consumed flag in RenderDesignerWindow to focus and persist Pack Manager selection.
- This guides new users directly to pack management workflow after onboarding decision.
